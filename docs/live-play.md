# Live play: confirmation cards

The user's decisions (2026-10-08):

- **Cards like the spell module's.** Using an ability from a monster's sheet posts a resolution card under PF2e's own ability message: its targets (the GM's targets), a roll button per target, then **Apply**, which the GM confirms. Simple effects get a card too ("confirmation-first for everything").
- **A target's owner rolls its own save** on the card; the GM can roll for anyone, and nothing is applied before the GM confirms.
- **Riders get a card after the hit.** When a monster's Strike hits and the Strike lists a rider (Grab, Knockdown, Push, a venom), a rider card appears under the Strike's result: Grab's Athletics check against the target, or the venom's save. The GM confirms the result.
- **The first slice is monster abilities:** breath weapons and other save abilities, Strike riders, Constrict, Swallow Whole. PCs' skill actions followed (below).

## How it works

- `src/live/card.js` (pure): the card's state (the ability's plan, the source, the targets and their rolls) and its HTML.
- `scripts/live.js` (Foundry): the triggers, the rolls, the result watcher and Apply. `scripts/auras.js` (Foundry) and `src/live/auras.js` (pure): the aura cards.
  - **Triggers** (on the active GM's client only): a monster's ability message (`flags.pf2e.origin.type === "action"`), an attack roll that hits with a Strike listing a rider, and a PC's skill-action check with a target.
  - **Rolls** go through PF2e's own statistics (a target's save, or the monster's skill against the target's DC), tagged `identifier: "aar:<card>:<target>"`. Whoever owns the roller rolls; the active GM's client writes the result onto the card.
  - **Apply** resolves the plan with the core (`registry.resolve`, the recorded degrees as `io.roll`), then applies the changes: damage through PF2e's `applyDamage` (its resistances and weaknesses), conditions, and afflictions handed to Pseudo Afflictions as the spell module does.

## Status (2026-10-08)

**Checked live in pftest** on a PFTEST SIM scene with PFTEST SIM iconics and monsters:
- **Poison Breath** (a save ability, 3 targets): the card appeared under PF2e's ability message. "Roll the rest" rolled each PC's Fortitude save through PF2e. On Apply, 9d6 was rolled once (28) and the two failures took the full 28 through PF2e's own damage; the critical success took nothing.
- **Giant Scorpion Venom** (a rider): a Stinger hit brought the venom card under the attack roll. A failed save handed the venom to Pseudo Afflictions, which made its affliction effect at stage 1, with enfeebled 1.
- **Grab** (a rider check): the anaconda's Athletics against the target's Fortitude DC. A success applied grabbed; a critical success, restrained, with a reminder of when it ends.

**Not yet:**

## Timed conditions and pushes (2026-10-08, the user's choice)

- **A condition with a duration** ("grabbed until the end of your next turn") is a PF2e effect on the target that grants the condition. Its origin is the monster, and its rounds are counted from where the monster sits in the turn order, as the spell module does: 0 when the monster still acts this round, otherwise 1. PF2e removes the effect and the condition when it runs out. Checked live: an anaconda's Grab in round 1 restrained a PC until the end of the anaconda's turn in round 2, then both were gone.
- **A push or pull** moves the token with the core's forced movement (`api.forcedMovement.forcedMove`, the user's grid rule of 2026-10-05). It goes square by square in the nearest of the 8 directions away from the monster, with diagonals 5 then 10 feet, stops at walls and the scene's edge, and never ends in another creature's space. Checked live: a Megalodon's Push moved a PC 2 squares, beside the anaconda rather than into it.
- **Push's distance:** a critical success pushes no less than the listed success distance (Shove's own critical push is 10 feet).

## PCs' skill actions (2026-10-08, the user's choice)

- **Trigger:** PF2e's own skill-action check (from the sheet or `game.pf2e.actions`) with a target: Demoralize, Trip, Grapple, Shove, Disarm, Feint, Create a Diversion, Reposition, Escape. The card appears with the check already recorded from PF2e's result ("Athletics 27 vs DC 22: success"); the GM presses Apply.
- **The user's own results** ("source"): Trip's critical failure leaves the user prone, Escape's success ends grabbed (and restrained, immobilized) on the user, Disarm's critical failure makes the user off-guard until the start of their next turn.
- **Off-guard to one creature** (Feint, Create a Diversion) is an effect on the creature whose attacks benefit. It marks the target's token (PF2e's TokenMark, as Hunt Prey does) and makes that target off-guard to its Strikes. Feint counts melee Strikes only (PF2e's `melee-strike-attack-roll`), Create a Diversion any Strike or spell attack. A success lasts for one attack: the active GM's client removes the effect after the next matching attack roll at the marked creature. A Feint's critical failure puts the effect on the target, against the user.
  - PF2e 8.5 names the mark `self:mark:<slug>` (not `target:mark:`) while it builds the target's side of the roll, so the rule accepts either.
- **Disarm:** a success adds PF2e's own Effect: Disarm (Success). Its weapon choice prompts the GM when the target has more than one attack. A critical success drops the target's best held weapon.
- **Reposition** has no automatic move (the user picks the square): the card says how far, with the names ("Move Giant Scorpion up to 5 feet, staying within Valeros's reach…").
- **Cards already in the chat log when Foundry loads** are drawn before the module's "ready"; their buttons are wired then.

**Checked live in pftest** (PFTEST SIM iconics and monsters):
- Demoralize: frightened 1.
- Feint:
  - a critical success made the scorpion off-guard to Merisiel's rapier (AC 16 for 18), not to the shortbow or against the anaconda;
  - a success counted for the next rapier Strike only;
  - a critical failure made Merisiel off-guard to the anaconda's Jaws (AC 20 for 22), not Seelah.
- Create a Diversion: off-guard to Merisiel's next shortbow shot only.
- Trip: target prone; on a critical failure, the user prone.
- Shove: the scorpion was pushed one square straight away.
- Grapple: grabbed until the end of Valeros's next turn.
- Disarm:
  - a success gave −2 with the chosen longsword;
  - a critical success dropped Ezren's Staff of Fire;
  - a critical failure made Valeros off-guard until the start of Valeros's next turn.
- Escape: grabbed ended.
- Reposition: the by-hand line.

## Auras (2026-10-08, the user's choices)

The user's decisions:
- **Foes only:** creatures whose token disposition differs from the monster's. The GM can add others with "Use my targets". Exceptions an aura names ("a non-demon creature", "a living creature") are the GM's call.
- **Combat start counts as entering:** when an encounter starts, every foe inside an aura that acts on entering gets its card ("in the aura as combat began").
- **A moving aura counts:** when the monster moves, foes its aura newly covers have entered it.
- **Combat only:** nothing triggers unless an encounter is running on the scene.

How it works:
- **When an aura acts** comes from its text (`src/compiler/auras.js`): a creature "enters" it, "starts its turn" in it, or "ends its turn" in it.
  - Frightful Presence acts on entering. Stench acts on entering and at turn start (PF2e's glossary text).
  - An aura that only deals damage (radius, damage, save) acts on entering and at turn start, once per round (Monster Core's rule).
  - An aura with no timing that does more than damage (Magic-Warping Aura acts when a creature Casts a Spell) has no trigger: the GM handles it.
  - Miasma acts only for the round after its Poison Breath.
  - Of 111 auras with a save in Monster Core, Monster Core 2 and NPC Core, 110 have a timing.
- **Triggers**, on the active GM's client, one at a time:
  - **Foundry's `moveToken`:** the path is checked square by square, so walking through an aura counts. A teleport or push counts only where it lands.
  - **Encounter start:** the encounter's first round begins.
  - **PF2e's `pf2e.startTurn` and `pf2e.endTurn`:** a creature starts or ends its turn.
  - **An NPC's ability message:** Miasma's Poison Breath.
- **Inside** is PF2e's distance from the monster's space, measured by the core's grid (`distanceFeet`): diagonals 5 then 10 feet, elevation as a third axis. Walls don't block; the GM confirms every card.
- **No card** for a creature that is immune, or already waiting on an open card from the same aura.
- **Immunity:** Apply records "temporarily immune …" as an effect on the creature ("Immune: Frightful Presence (Horned Dragon)", 1 minute), for the results that grant it.
  - Frightful Presence grants it whatever the result. Stench grants it on a success, to every stench aura.
  - The same applies to any card whose ability grants immunity, Demoralize's 10 minutes included.
  - PF2e removes the effect when it runs out.

**Checked live in pftest** (PFTEST SIM iconics, the young horned dragon, and a new PFTEST SIM Ghoul Soldier, in an encounter on the Live Cards scene):
- Starting the encounter brought one Frightful Presence card for the four PCs.
  - Three failed (frightened 2) and Merisiel succeeded (frightened 1).
  - All four got a 1-minute immunity effect.
- Walking Valeros next to the ghoul brought a Stench card ("entered the aura").
  - Walking him out and back in while it was open brought no second card.
  - His success made him immune to every stench aura.
- Moving the ghoul beside the others brought one card for Seelah, Ezren and Merisiel (Seelah exactly 10 feet away), not the immune Valeros.
- Merisiel's turn start brought no card (immune). With Seelah's immunity removed, her turn start brought one ("started its turn in the aura").
- With the encounter deleted, walking into the stench brought no card.

**Not yet:**
- An aura's effects that last only while a creature stays in it ("can't reduce its frightened below 1 while in the aura").
- Auras that act on other triggers (casting a spell).
- Stench's "or recovers from being sickened" immunity.

## Swallow Whole and Engulf over the turns (2026-10-08, the user's choice)

- **Apply** on a Swallow Whole or Engulf card deals the damage and gives the creature a "Swallowed by …" effect (`scripts/swallow.js`, `src/live/swallow.js`):
  - grabbed and slowed 1, granted by the effect so they end with it;
  - the monster off-guard to its Strikes (a token mark, as Feint's);
  - the rules in its description: hold its breath, unarmed or light weapons only, Escape, Rupture, the 3 actions to cut open a dead monster.
  - The grab that held it in the jaws ends, as PF2e's text says.
- **At the end of each of its turns** (`pf2e.endTurn`, active GM), the listed damage is rolled as a PF2e damage roll, with an "Apply to …" button for the GM. Several damage types roll together ("{(3d10+10)[bludgeoning],2d6[fire]}"). There's no roll once the monster is dead.
- **Rupture:** when the monster takes piercing or slashing damage of at least its Rupture value from one attack or spell, a card offers "Cut free" for each creature it holds. The core's applyDamage listener notices this. The damage counted is the roll's piercing and slashing before resistances.
- **Escape:** the Escape card's success ends grabbed, and the effect goes with it (and slowed with the effect).
- Tokens aren't moved in or out: the GM places a creature that gets out.

**Checked live in pftest** (the PFTEST SIM Megalodon and Valeros, in an encounter on the Live Cards scene):
- Swallow Whole's card dealt 14 bludgeoning (78 to 64 HP) and gave the effect: grabbed and slowed 1, and the earlier grab ended.
- Valeros's longsword needed AC 25 against the megalodon (27, off-guard), and stayed at 25 against the anaconda.
- At the end of Valeros's turn: a 2d8+5 roll (10) with "Apply to Valeros", which took him to 54.
- Rupture:
  - 15 slashing to the megalodon brought no card;
  - 25 slashing and 10 fire brought one, and "Cut free" ended the effect with its grabbed and slowed.
- Swallowed again: with the megalodon at 0 HP, his turn ended with no roll.
- His Escape (a critical success) ended grabbed, and the effect and slowed went with it.

## Recharging abilities (2026-10-08, the user's choices)

The user's decisions:
- **The recharge starts on Apply:** it's rolled when the GM applies the card, and the card shows it ("Poison Breath recharges in 2 rounds (1d4)"). A recharging ability with no card (37 in the bestiary, such as Ink Cloud) starts when used from the sheet, with a note to the GM.
- **Reuse is warned, not blocked:** using it again while it recharges still brings its card, with a warning ("Poison Breath is still recharging: 1 round left."). The GM decides.

How it works (`scripts/recharge.js`, `src/live/recharge.js`):
- **The effect:** "Recharging: …" on the monster, lasting the rolled number of rounds. It ends at the start of the monster's turn, counted on the monster's own initiative whoever's turn the GM applies it on. PF2e removes it when it runs out.
- **Applying again** starts a new recharge in place of the old one.
- **The formula** comes from the plan (182 of the bestiary's 219 recharging abilities) or from the text ("[[/gmr 1d4 #Recharge …]]", "can't use … again for 1d4 rounds").
- **Draconic Momentum:** a critical hit with a Strike ends the recharge of the abilities it names, with a note to the GM (active GM).

**Checked live in pftest** (the young horned dragon and Valeros, in an encounter on the Live Cards scene):
- Poison Breath's card: Valeros took 15 poison, and the breath recharged in 2 rounds.
- Breathing again at once brought a card warning "2 rounds left"; in round 2 the warning said "1 round left".
- A critical Jaws hit ended the recharge, with the GM note.
- A 1-round recharge was gone at the start of the dragon's next turn, and its next breath had no warning.
